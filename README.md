Core Essence Of Reality Website 
==========================
## This is a Sub-heading
Core Essence is an art and awareness company.
--------------------------
This website was constructed for a capstone project. The purpose is to show understanding of basic html and css language. 
I created core essence of reality, it is my mental health awareness instagram page that I transformed into an ecommerce website.
The products for sale are photos from my Instagram page as we release products of sale by core essence. 
The company started as an instagram page and moved into an online store. This website is functional but not ready to use.
