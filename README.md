# Core Essence Of Reality Website 
==========================
## Core Essence is an art and awareness company.
--------------------------
This website was constructed for a capstone project. The purpose is to show understanding of basic html and css language. 
I created core essence of reality, it is my mental health awareness instagram page that I transformed into an ecommerce website.
The products for sale are photos from my Instagram page as we release products of sale by core essence. 
The company started as an instagram page and moved into an online store. This website is functional but not ready to use.

The pages include:
 * Homepage
 * About Us
 * Product Page
 * Create an Account
 * Login 
 * Checkout 

This an interesting CSS that I wrote. It allows you to hover and create a color for your hover effect:
```
.navbar{
    box-shadow: 0 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)
 }



.navbar-light .navbar-nav .nav-link {
    padding: 0 20px;
    color: black;
    transition: 0.3s ease;
}

.navbar-light .navbar-nav .nav-link:hover,
.navbar i:hover,
.navbar-light .navbar-nav .nav-link.active
.navbar i.active{
    color: greenyellow;
}

.navbar i {
    font-size: 1.2rem;
    padding: 0 7px; 
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: 0.3s ease;
}
```
